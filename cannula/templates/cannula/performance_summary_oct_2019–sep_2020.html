The geographical factors (vast water bodies) and human economic activities (rice growing and sugar cane growing) that is associated with stagnant water has greatly contributed to the vast mosquito breeding grounds resulting into high malaria burden in the East central region. Only Bugiri (20.8%), Jinja (30.1%) Namutumba (31.1%) Iganga (42.0%) and Mayuge (49.4%) districts had annual average of malaria burden less than 50% of the annual outpatient attendance. The relatively lower burden is probably due to Indoor residual spraying supported by PMI Vector Link in Namutumba and Bugiri districts. Jinja district being more urban than any other district performed better on this indicator probably because individuals in urban setting are more likely to take up malaria prevention measures like use of LLINs coupled with better housing facilities screened from mosquitoes than the rural population.</span></p></th>

Such performance is attributed to the onsite support to health facilities during clinical audits, onsite clinical mentorship, and training of health workers on Integrated Malaria Management. Cumulatively, the performance slightly surpasses the 100%.  The numerator for this indicator looks at the total number of tests done in a facility including outpatient cases and inpatient cases in laboratory register  while the denominator looks at the suspected malaria cases in OPD register and yet some patients go directly to the inpatient wards partly explains the performance exceeding 100%. A few admitted patients who don’t do well on 1st line treatment are done a repeat malaria test on malaria microscopy to find out if they still have malaria parasites also contributes to more test done than the suspected malaria cases.</span></p></th>

At health facilities, during a joint onsite mentorship, facilities were guided on addressing identified barriers to timely ANC attendance as shared during previous and currently conducted community dialogues. For example; increasing days in the week when ANC services are offered, engaging staff at OPD to screen and refer women in reproductive age for pregnancy testing at the lab using hCG kits, reducing client waiting time, provision of Tea to women at ANC clinics and procuring of urine hCG kits using RBF funds to supplement on National Medical Stores (NMS) deliveries.

This good performance on appropriate treatment of neonates diagnosed with sepsis/infection in  FY20 is attributable to onsite dissemination and orientation of service providers on IMNCI, mentorships on management of newborn infections at 37 facilities (12 newborn care units and an additional 25), data use during forecasting thereby improving availability of the recommended antibiotics and availability of treatment guidelines.
            
                    In FY21, RHITES-EC will continue with health facility mentorships on sick newborn management, infection prevention and control measures, prophylactic treatment for newborns at risk of sepsis, improvement in quality of newborn care data, adequate forecasting for drugs using consumption data and adherence to the National treatment protocols while women/caretaker will be continuously counselled on newborn care practices during postnatal period and at discharge including early seeking of care for the sick newborn.</span></p></th>

All districts within the EC region achieved above 90% of DPT3 coverage in  FY20QQ1. 33% of these were reached through outreach in the annual year. This improvement is attributed to several interventions to improve utilization of EPI services in the region. These included District engagement meetings and performance review to analyze bottle necks to ppr performance and micro action plan to  target poor performing sub counties and facilities for QI support such as support to facility and district microplanning in 8 districts of the region, VHT mapping of children with missed opportunity for vaccination through SBCC  to improve knowledge and attitudes as well linkage and referral and  integrated outreach in  hard to reach populations including the islands of Mayuge.  The district of Luuka had the least performance of 90%. In  FY20.  In FY21, efforts will be put to sustain the performance and target low performing districts and their sub counties to map out defaulters, strengthen static EPI clinics and outreaches as well as support DHT supervision and mentorship.

Increase in burden registered in  FY20Q4 is attributed to improved facility level assessment to increase case identification, reduced dietary intake due to food insecurity as a result of poor socioeconomic practices such as commercial sugarcane growing at expense of household food production, disruption  of food systems due to COVID19 pandemic that affected household food and nutrient intake.</span></p></th>

Access was largely affected by reduced coverage following reduction in number of outpatient therapeutic care (OTC) sites from 21 facilities to 15 during the year.  The challenge was exacerbated by inadequate, irregular, and reduced supply of therapeutic foods to the 15 selected sites along the year by the collaborating partner (MAUL).

Point of care (PoC) facility for EID testing that resumed in  FY20Q4 supported intensified screening of infants at all entry points at JRRH and reduced turnaround time of results to one (1) hour. EPI/EID integration will be further strengthened using the testing algorithm for HEI less than 18 months of age to screen infants in the community, YCC, OPD and inpatient wards.

  font-family:"Gill Sans MT",sans-serif;'>There has been a great improvement from 86% at the end of FY20Q3 to the current  88% at the end of FY20 Q4. This is attributed to targeted viral load testing at sites with low VL testing coverage through the VL testing mop-up campaign, prior ART clinic day preparations that enabled sorting and prioritization of files for clients due for VL testing, integration of VL sample removal in ART home deliveries for eligible clients unable to come to facilities due to COVID-19 prevention lockdown and transport challenges, extension of the viral load mop-up exercise to all sites that enabled teams to provide appropriate services to eligible clients, integration of VL testing for children and adolescents in facility-based caregivers’/psychosocial support meetings, streamlining of the sample and results referral and transportation through weekly monitoring of the Laboratory hub system performance, and facilitating results and sample transportation to island facilities and satellite ART clinics in Namayingo, Mayuge and Buyende districts.</span></p> <p class=Normal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Gill Sans MT",sans-serif;'>However, there were delays and inadequacies in sample receipt, details capture and processing at CPHL as a result of their system upgrade and other system challenges that have increased the turnaround time (TAT) for results – thus negatively affecting the overall VL monitoring processes.  The project will work with CPHL and the Laboratory hub system to track all client samples whose results have not been received at the sending hubs/sites. The project will also continue to support VL testing mop-up campaign and targeted VL testing of all eligible clients at sites and in districts with existing gaps in VL testing coverage to support achievement of the set targets.</span></p></th>

  font-family:"Gill Sans MT",sans-serif;'>There was an improvement in patient viral suppression from 85% at the end FY20Q3 to  89% by the end of FY20Q4. This is attributed to on-site mentorship and coaching on ART treatment optimization for all clients, provision of tailored services package for the non-suppressed clients, and engaging experienced counselors to provide high quality adherence counseling especially to the non-suppressed clients. The project has engaged district-based teams/trainers for AYPLHIVs and scaled up YAPS program to additional 15 health facilities in three districts of Busia, Bugiri and Iganga making a total of 21 sites in four districts with the YAPS program, piloted stable DSD models for children and adolescents in 12 high volume sites, encouraged regular clinical visits for children and adolescents, and employed quality improvement approaches to manage the virally non-suppressed children and adolescents along the viral load non-suppression management cascade. The project will support rollout, uptake and implementation of the 2020 revised HIV guidelines including ART regimen optimization for all client categories, as well as strengthen quality counselling and psychosocial support structures including DSD models to support improvements in viral load suppression rates to achieve the set targets. The project will deepen partnerships with USAID supported OVC partners like BOCY to provide psychosocial support and counselling services to all children and adolescents in care to support and enhance their adherence to care and treatment to further promote viral suppression among these patient groups.</span></p></th>
